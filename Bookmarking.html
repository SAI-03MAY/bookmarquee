    <h1 id="early life">Early life</h1>
    <p>Leonhard Euler was born in Basel on 15 April 1707 to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite (n√©e Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars in the classics.[19] He was the oldest of four children, with two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.[20][19] Soon after Leonhard's birth, the Eulers moved from Basel to Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.[19]

        From a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.[19]
        
        In 1720, at age 13, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel.[7] Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time.[19] The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli, who had taught Euler's father. Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:[21]
        
        the famous professor Johann Bernoulli [...] made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he refused because of his busy schedule. However, he gave me a far more salutary advice, which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence, and should I encounter some objections or difficulties, he offered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties, which was done with such a desired advantage that, when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences.</p>

    <p>hann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available.[26] On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia.[29][30] When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler.[26] In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.[26]

        Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727.[26][23] He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration.[31] Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.[32]</p>

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Euler%27s_formula.svg/500px-Euler%27s_formula.svg.png" height="300" width="340">
    <p>Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, including geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as continuum physics, lunar theory, and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes.[42] Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics. Euler's work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783. He also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts. It has been estimated that Leonhard Euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18th century, while other researchers credit Euler for a third of the output in mathematics in that century.[9]</p>
    <h1 id="mathematical notation">Mathematical notation</h1> 
    <p>Mathematical notation
        Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function[6] and was the first to write f(x) to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter Œ£ for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary unit.[71] The use of the Greek letter œÄ to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.[72]</p>
    <h1 id="number theory">Number theory</h1>
    <p>Euler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach,[83] his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy.[64] Much of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the work of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures, such as his conjecture that all numbers of the form 
        2
        2
        n
        +
        1
        {\textstyle 2^{2^{n}}+1} (Fermat numbers) are prime.[84]
        
        Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.[85]
        
        Euler invented the totient function œÜ(n), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem.[86] He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (which he had earlier proved) was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid‚ÄìEuler theorem.[87] Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem within number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss, particularly Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.[88] By 1772 Euler had proved that 231 ‚àí 1 = 2,147,483,647 is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867.[89]</p>
    <h1 id="eyesight deterioation">Eyesight deterioation</h1>
    <p>Euler's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly dying of fever,[64] he became almost blind in his right eye. Euler blamed the cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition,[65] but the cause of his blindness remains the subject of speculation.[66][67] Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick called him "Cyclops". Euler said of his loss of vision, "Now I will have fewer distractions."[65] In 1766 a cataract in his left eye was discovered. Though couching of the cataract temporarily improved his vision, complications rendered him almost totally blind in the left eye as well.[42] His condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity in many areas of study increased;[68] in 1775, he produced, on average, one mathematical paper per week.[42]</p>
    <h1 id="recognition">Recognition</h1>
    <p>Euler is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and more likely than not the most prolific contributor to mathematics and science.[11] Mathematician and physicist John von Neumann called Euler "the greatest virtuoso of the period".[129] Mathematician Fran√ßois Arago said, "Euler calculated without any apparent effort, just as men breathe and as eagles sustain themselves in air".[130] He is generally ranked right below Carl Friedrich Gauss, Isaac Newton, and Archimedes among the greatest mathematicians of all time,[130] while some rank him as equal with them.[131] Physicist and mathematician Henri Poincar√© called Euler the "god of mathematics".[132</p>
